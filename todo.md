# TODO

## Create a tools section

### Should have the option to concatenate pdf.

    Some books I have to manually create digital version from, I will make the first 5 pages, then later I will add 5 more pages. Should have an option to select a book pdf and then add more pages to it by uploading another pdf and concatenating them.

### Ability to create audio files from the video files.

    Some video files I have are just lessons with no audio files. It would be great to have an option to extract audio from video files and create audio files from them.

## Upload videos

### when uploading videos, should have an option to select existing books that contain videos

## Audio player

### When no track is selected hide audio player

### When clicking away from book/ on a new book clear the current track

## UI
### Should have the option to upload images for books with missing covers
